## What is this?
This is meant to be a toolbox of generators, brute forcers, and OSINT tools for the japanese language. Instead of generating from all 26 american letters, it revolves around a lookup table that contains all of the Japanese characters. It's a work in progress. If you'd like to help, please consider contributing! Any help is greatly appreciated because my coding quality isn't the best. 

## TODO/PLANS
- [ ] Create module for converting usernames to Emails/Alt Usernames (The code is all there, but it's buggy and it dosen't work, sadly.)
- [ ] Create modules for both Twitter and NicoNico
- [ ] Create module for converting Names to Usernames based on a RefList
- [ ] Create a centralized command line interface which controls all the tools (this will probably be the last thing to do when all the modules are complete.)
