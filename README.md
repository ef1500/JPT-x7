## What is this?
This is meant to be a toolbox of generators, brute forcers, and other tools for the japanese language. Instead of generating from all 26 american letters, it revolves around a lookup table that contains all of the Japanese characters. It's a work in progress. If you'd like to help, please consider contributing!
