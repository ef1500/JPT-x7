Twitter Crawler

Step 1) Gain Information about target
	-Extract Hashtags
	-Extract any Names from originating from target's posts
		-Set this as a keyword
	-Extract any Images
	-Extract any audio
	-Extract all text from tweets and organize them neatly
	-Extract all geodata from tweets
	-Extract dates and times from tweets

Step 2) Profiling target's Connections (Who target Follows and/or who follows the target)
	-Extract Hashtags
	-Extract any Images
	-Extract any audio
	-Extract all text from tweets and organize it neatly
	-Extract all geodata
	-Extract dates and times from tweets

Step 3) Test data from target against connections
	-Find common hashtags
		-Determine who has the most posts on this hashtag
	-Find Similar Images
	-Determine similarity of audio
	-Find all common and recurring words
	-See if any Names reoccur in connection's tweets
	-Determine if there is similar geodata (if any)
	-Check for recurring similar dates/times of tweets
		-If retweet, discard the data
	-Organize the results neatly

Step 4) Recrawl With New data
	-Crawl all Common Hashtags
	-Determine Decentralized targets
		-Add user with most posts to the hashtags as a decentralized target
		-Add user with most similar audio as a decentralized target
		-Add user with most keyword matches as decentralized target
	-Update Graph in real-time so the user can watch as it does its thing.
	-Go to step 1 and repeat entire process for each decentralized target

Subprocess for layers

So in a "layer", we have nodes, which are basically, the users that are connected to the target in 
some way. We need a way to identify each node, and additionally a way to build a profile of each node
in the centralized network. 

Proposal:
Assign a token to each node, allowing for easy access and lookup of each node. 
This token will be a sha-256 hash of the users' names (may change this)

Each layer will consist of tokens for the current node, parent node, and root node. Similar to a blockchain system.
