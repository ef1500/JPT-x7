Step 1) Gain Information about target
	-Extract Hashtags
	-Extract any Names from originating from target's posts

	-Extract dates and times from tweets

Step 2) Profiling target's Connections (Who target Follows and/or who follows the target)
	-Extract Hashtags
	-Extract any Images
	-Extract any audio
	-Extract all text from tweets and organize it neatly

Step 3) Test data from target against connections

	-Organize the results neatly

Step 4) Recrawl With New data
	-Crawl all Common Hashtags
	-Determine Decentralized targets
		-Add user with most posts to the hashtags as a decentralized target
		-Add user with most similar audio as a decentralized target
		-Add user with most keyword matches as decentralized target
	-Update Graph in real-time so the user can watch as it does its thing.
	-Go to step 1 and repeat entire process for each decentralized target
